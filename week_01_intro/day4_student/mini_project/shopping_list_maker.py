# Mini-Project: Interactive Shopping List

# Create an empty list to hold the shopping items

# Print a welcome message and instructions to the user

# Start an infinite loop to keep asking for items

    # Ask the user to type an item to add

    # If the user types "done", break out of the loop

    # Otherwise, add the item to the shopping list

    # Print a message saying the item was added

# After the loop, print the final shopping list

# Use a loop to print each item in the list with a number (starting at 1)
