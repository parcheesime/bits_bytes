# 🟢 Week 1 – Python Playground

**Theme:** Getting comfortable with VS Code + Python

Welcome to Week 1 of Python Summer Camp! This week introduces students to the basics of Python through a mix of hands-on coding, creative mini projects, and differentiated challenges. The goal is to get students confident with print statements, variables, input, strings, and simple math — all while having fun.

Students are encouraged to work independently or in **pair programming** groups to explore different levels of each daily challenge.

## 🗓️ Day-by-Day Breakdown

### 📅 Day 1 – Welcome, Setup, and About Me
**Focus:** Light coding + camp intro + VS Code setup

We'll kick things off with an interactive orientation to the course. Today is all about getting to know your tools *and each other!*

#### 🧰 Activities:
- Welcome tour & class expectations
- Icebreaker: "Code Your Name!"
- Get familiar with VS Code
  - Opening folders and files
  - Saving your code
  - Running a Python file
- Logging in/out and project folder structure

#### 🔍 Follow-Along – About Me Intro
```python
name = "Ms T"
color = "blue"
print("Hello, my name is " + name + ".")
print(f"My favorite color is {color}!")
```

#### ✍️ Fill in the Code
```python
# name = "____"
# food = "____"
# print("Hi, I'm " + ____) 
# print(f"I love eating {____}!")
```

#### 🧩 Code Puzzle
```python
# print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}!")
# name = "Taylor"
# print("Hello!")
```

#### 🚀 Mini Project Prompt
Create an "About Me Poster" using:
- Your name
- Favorite animal
- A fun fact

Format the output clearly using print statements.

#### 🎯 Challenge
Build a digital name tag with:
- Name in uppercase
- Favorite emoji
- Favorite color

#### 📈 Advanced Teaser
Introduce string methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.title()`, `len()`

### 📅 Day 2 – User Input and String Combo
**Mini Project:** Mad Libs
- Use `input()` and combine with f-strings to create silly sentences
- Add replay options using simple structure
- Advanced: nested inputs or string methods

---

### 📅 Day 3 – Interview Bot
**Mini Project:** Fake Interview Script
- Use input + variables to simulate a chatbot interview
- Challenge: Create different paths based on answers (branching sneak peek)
- Advanced: Build a mini Q&A loop using string questions

---

### 📅 Day 4 – Math Magician
**Mini Project:** Tiny Calculator
- Use `int()` or `float()` + input
- Create a calculator with two numbers and an operation
- Challenge: Handle bad inputs, do multiple operations
- Advanced: Use `format()` or create custom functions

---

### 📅 Day 5 – 🧠 Cumulative Mini Project: Story Generator
Pull together variables, input, and strings to build a story generator:
- Ask at least 6 questions
- Print a formatted story or scene
- Add replay option, character choices, or branching

#### 🎯 Extensions:
- Use lists or basic conditions
- Organize story in multiple `print()` blocks
- Format output as a visual book cover
