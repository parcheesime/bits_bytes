# 🔵 Week 3 – Functions, Modular Code, and GUI

**Theme:** Building like a real developer: clean code, reusable functions, and visual interfaces

Welcome to Week 3! This week students will level up their Python skills by organizing code into functions, splitting files into modules, and exploring graphical interfaces. We'll use everything learned in Weeks 1 and 2 to help them design and develop a final project.

Students continue using the core learning structure (follow-along, fill-in-the-code, code puzzles, mini projects, open-ended challenges, and advanced teasers). They'll be encouraged to work in teams or solo as they prep for their final showcase.

## 🗓️ Day-by-Day Breakdown

### 📅 Day 1 – Functions and Reusability
**Mini Project:** Modular Greeter

#### 🔍 Follow-Along:
Create a basic `greet_user()` function and call it with different names

#### ✍️ Fill in the Code:
Complete function bodies and add parameters

#### 🧩 Puzzle:
Unscramble a program with 3 separate helper functions

#### 🚀 Mini Project:
Build a greeter or mini calculator that uses at least 3 custom functions

#### 📈 Advanced Teaser:
Add return values and reuse them; add type hints

---

### 📅 Day 2 – Importing and Organizing Code
**Mini Project:** Utilities Module
- Create a `tools.py` file with multiple helper functions
- Import and reuse these in a main file
- Challenge: Build a program split into 2–3 files
- Advanced: Use `__name__ == '__main__'` guard and docstrings

---

### 📅 Day 3 – 🖼️ GUI Day: Tkinter or Pygame Intro
**Mini Project:** GUI Greeting App or Clicker Game

Students choose:
- Build a simple windowed app using `tkinter` with buttons and input
- OR use `pygame` to create an interactive screen with drawing or click logic

Challenge: Add interactivity, color changes, or movement

Advanced Teaser: Add images or track game state (score, clicks)

### 📅 Day 4 – Final Project Design Day
Students sketch out and begin building their **Final Projects**, using:
- Functions
- Logic (from Week 2)
- Inputs and strings (from Week 1)
- Optional GUI or Turtle if they choose

---

### 📅 Day 5 – Showcase!
**Students present their Final Projects** to the class.

Project types might include:
- Quiz app with different categories
- Text adventure with choices and endings
- GUI calculator or clicker game
- Virtual pet or character simulator

Students will write a short reflection or walkthrough of how their code works.

Week 3 shows students how to think like developers: reuse code, organize files, and build programs with multiple parts and visual flair. Let's wrap with a bang!
