# 🐍 Python Summer Camp: Intro to Text-Based Programming

Welcome to the **Python Summer Camp**! This 3-week course is designed for students in grades 8–10 who are transitioning from block-based coding (like Scratch or Code.org) to text-based programming using Python in VS Code.

## 🗓️ Weekly Overview (under construction)

| Week | Focus Area                       | Mini Project            | Special Theme Day        |
|------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1    | Syntax, Strings, Input, Printing | Story Generator          | Setup + VS Code Day       |
| 2    | Conditionals, Loops, Lists       | Quiz Game                | 🐢 Turtle + OOP Art Day    |
| 3    | Functions, Modules, GUI          | Modular Calculator       | 🖼️ GUI Day (Tkinter/Pygame) |

## 🧩 Learning Format
Each lesson follows a structured and differentiated format:

- 🔍 **Follow-Along**: Guided code demos
- ✍️ **Fill in the Code**: Partially completed examples to finish
- 🧩 **Code Puzzle**: Unscramble or debug broken code
- 🚀 **Mini Project**: Small creative builds
- 🎯 **Challenge**: Open-ended coding task
- 📈 **Advanced Teaser**: A sneak peek into more advanced ideas
